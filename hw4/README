I had work3ed on this assignment for 8 hours since I treid
getting a faster lighting result by using the programming
guides lighting code which I wasn't able to debug.
After I scraped the idea and started from scratch I was able
to get the assignment done in roughly an hour by following the
ex04 blinn phong lighting example.

Had to run my code on windows qt creator as the VM doesn't
have opengl 3 or 4.
