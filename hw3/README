HW 3: investigation of performance

how to run:
- go to directory
- qmake hw03.pro
- make
- ./hw03

Report on performance
The program contains a base as a baseline which is the Blinn-Phong pixel lighting and the experimental textures.
The first experiment was to see the run time between my linux VM and native windows.
-VM		: the average framerate was 3500 for cube with range 2000-4500 and 850 with range 500-1000 for teapot 
-Native	: the average framerade was 3800 with range of 1500-4000 for the cube and 800 with range of 500-1000 for the teapot
for both the framerate was erratic and there wasn't distinguishable 
results from the qt creator running natively and the vmware workstation.

The rest of the experiments are done in the VM.
Another experiment was to check if passing in variables from main to the blinn function does anything
-baseline	: The average is about 4000 fps with range of 2500-5000 fps
-experiment	: The average is about 3800 fps with range of 2300-4500 fps
Thus the result is inconclusive 


Another experiment was to check if there is a large performance drop by having branching on the linux VM 
remove ifs	(multiply by (a>b)	: the average framerate was about 3000 with range of 1500-4000 fps and for cube and 600 for teapot with range of 400-900
only if							: the average framerate was about 3500 with range of 2000-4000 fps and for cube and 600 for teapot with range of 400-900
adding unneeded else			: the average framerate was about 2500 with range of 1500-4000 fps and for the cube and 500 for the teapot with range of 300-800 fps
Thus branching does produce a worse result for the shader but the fps computation is quite erratic which means 
that there might not be anything of note. The biggest differance is the switch from the cube to the teapot which 
is explained by the higher polygon count of the teapot. 

removing branching and having everything done on the main function produces the result
of a framerate average of 3800 with a range of 2600-4800 fps
